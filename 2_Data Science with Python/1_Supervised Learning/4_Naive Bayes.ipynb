    "**Principle:** Naive Bayes operates on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence among features. It calculates the probability of a given data point belonging to a particular class based on the probabilities of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Principle:**\n",
    "1.\t**Assumption of Independence:** Naive Bayes assumes that all features are independent of each other given the class label.\n",
    "2.\t**Probability Calculation:** It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to each class based on the probability of its features occurring in that class using Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamental Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Bayes' Theorem:** The algorithm relies on Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a class given a set of features by incorporating prior probabilities and likelihoods.\n",
    "- **Assumption of Independence:** Despite its simplifying assumption, Naive Bayes can work well in practice, especially in text classification and spam filtering.\n",
    "- **Application:** Text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Strengths:** Efficient, handles high-dimensional data, works well with small datasets.\n",
    "- **Considerations:** Assumes independence between features, can be overly simplistic for complex relationships.\n"
