    "## Reduce Complexity of Model\n",
    "As we've seen in creating Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning models, the number of predictors plays a large role in each model. The more predictors we have, the more complex the model and the higher risk of overfitting our training data in a way that is not predictive. So the major question is: how do we reduce the complexity of our model without indescriminantly throwing out data? "

    "## Feature Selection or Feature Projection?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general methods to reducing the number for features in your model: selection and projection. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection** involves systematically choosing a smaller set of features to focus on and removing the rest. For example, consider our 13-feature wine dataset. One could systematically create Decision Tree models for every possible 4-feature combination *(715 combinations in total)* and compare the resulting five-fold cross-validation accuracy averages to determine the 4 features to keep. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Projection** involves mathematically combining multiple features into new, singular \"Frankenstein\" features. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is such a method, where the principal axes are linear combinations of multiple features. This still results in loss of data, but in a \"mathematically minimal\" way. Explaining the mathematics behind these methods is beyond the scope of this survey course and is best revisited after taking a Linear Algebra course."
