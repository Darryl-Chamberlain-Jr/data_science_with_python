    "In this lesson, we will learn the absolute fundamentals to get you coding. First, we introduce Jupyter Notebook - a web application that can interpret many different types of programming languages. In the top-right, we see it is running Python 3. At the end of the course, we will download a new language and work with it in Jupyter Notebook. For now, we learn the fundamentals of programming for Data Science using Python. "

    "\n",
    "**A *set* is a collection of unique objects defined using braces.** For example, \"{a, b, c}\". Unlike lists, sets will throw away duplicates and is inherently unordered. "
